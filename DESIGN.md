1. 512,000 password variations were hashed and checked for a match given the two passwords that were tested. Since each of the passwords of "secret118" and "secret111" contain 8 alphabetic characters and 3 numbers, the program would test for all possible case variations of 256 since 2^8. The numberic portion of the password, the program tests all possible digits 0-9 of the 3 positions, so 10^3 = 1000. Each password has 256 * 1000 = 256,000 total variations.

2. The program tests lowercase characters that are already in lowercase form, so that results in 6 duplicate tests for each password. Alongside the digit itself, that adds another 3 duplicates. In total, there are 9 duplicate variations per passwords, which is 18 duplicate hashes and checks for both respective passwords.

3. I would say to optimize and avoid redundancy in my program for hte future would be to implement a case-sensitive check before applying case transofmrations in order to eliminate unnecessary conversions of lowercase letters that are already lowercase. This can also be the same for numbers where I coudl skip testing a digit against itself. This would optimize performance and reduce redundant computations for the computer. I would also say for more complex optimizations, I think I could implement bitwise operations for the password checking process. I think this would save on performance and also utilize the bare memory.
